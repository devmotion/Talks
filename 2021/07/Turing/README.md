# Probabilistic Modelling with Turing.jl

I gave this talk at the meetup of the Julia User Group Munich on 5 July 2021.

## Note

The talk uses the unreleased package manager of [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl).
If you want to rerun or edit the notebook, you should use the following version of Pluto:
